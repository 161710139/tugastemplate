      ALBUM = IN A PERFECT WORLD
      <br><br>
Broken bottles in the hotel lobby<br>
Seems to me like I'm just scared of never feelin' it again<br>
I know its crazy to believe in silly things<br>
It's not that easy<br>
<br>
I remember it now it takes me back to when it all first started<br>
But I only got myself to blame for it and I accept it now<br>
It's time to let it all go, go out and start again<br>
It's not that easy<br><br>

But I've got high hopes<br>
It takes me back to when we started<br>
High hopes<br>
When you let it go go out and start again<br>
High hopes<br>
When it all comes to an end<br>
But the world keeps spinning around<br><br>
And in my dreams I meet the ghosts of all the people who've come and gone<br>
Memories they seem to show up so quick but they leave you far too soon<br>
Naive I was just staring at the barrel of a gun<br>
I do believe it<br><br>
But I've got high hopes<br>
It takes me back to when we started<br>
High hopes<br>
When you let it go go out and start again<br>
High hopes<br>
When it all comes to an end<br>
But the world keeps spinning around<br><br>
But I've got high hopes<br>
It takes me back to when we started<br>
High hopes<br>
When you let it go go out and start again<br>
High hopes<br>
When it all comes to an end<br>
But the world keeps spinning around
[x2]<br><br>
Yeah this world keeps spinning<br>
How this world keeps spinning around<br>

<h1 class="my-4">All I Want - 
        <small>Kodaline</small>
      </h1>
<hr>
All I want is nothing more<br>
To hear you knocking at my door<br>
'Cause if I could see your face once more<br>
I could die as a happy man I'm sure<br><br>
When you said your last goodbye<br>
I died a little bit inside<br>
I lay in tears in bed all night<br>
Alone without you by my side<br><br>
But If you loved me<br>
Why did you leave me<br><br>
Take my body<br>
Take my body<br>
All I want is<br>
All I need is<br>
To find somebody<br>
I'll find somebody<br><br>
Ooh oh<br>
Ooh oh<br>
Ooh oh<br>
Ooh oh<br><br>
'Cause you brought out the best of me<br>
A part of me I'd never seen<br>
You took my soul wiped it clean<br>
Our love was made for movie screens<br><br>
But If you loved me<br>
Why did you leave me<br>
Take my body<br>
Take my body<br>
All I want is<br>
All I need is<br>
To find somebody<br>
I'll find somebody<br><br>
Ooh oh<br>
Ooh oh<br>
Ooh oh<br>
Ooh oh<br>
Ooh ah<br>
Ooh oh<br><br>
